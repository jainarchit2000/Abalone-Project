## Abalone Rings Prediction

Abalones are marine snails. The age of abalone is determined with the help of number of rings on it's shell.
Age of Abalone (in yrs) = 1.5+number of rings on its shell
Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the number of rings present on the shell of an abalone with the help of few input variables.
